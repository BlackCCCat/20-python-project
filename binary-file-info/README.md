# Binary File Info

In this project, you will practice working with binary files that aren't encoded text.
You will write a program that accepts the name of a file from standard input, and prints out the following information about that file:
- The name of the file (as it was entered to the program)
- The size of the file
- The type of the file, by checking for common patterns in the bytes 


## Steps
- Open the file in 'rb' read-binary mode
- It will use the first five letters or characters to determine the extension

# BMI Calculator

A Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator is a simple Python program that allows you to calculate your BMI based on your weight and height. This tool provides a quick and easy way to assess your body's health and categorize your weight as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese.

## How to Use the BMI Calculator

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by running the following command:
```python bmi_calculator.py```

2. **Input Your Weight and Height**: You will be prompted to enter your weight in kilograms and your height in meters.
```sh
Enter your weight (kg): 70
Enter your height (m): 1.75
```

3. **View Your BMI**: The script will calculate your BMI and display the result, as well as your BMI category (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese).
```sh
Your BMI is 22.86
Category: Normal
```

## BMI Categories
The BMI Calculator categorizes your BMI as follows:

- **Underweight**: BMI less than 18.5
- **Normal**: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
- **Overweight**: BMI between 25 and 29.9
- **Obese**: BMI of 30 or greater

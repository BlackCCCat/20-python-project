# Project - Directory Maintainer

Imagine you have a folder containing files with various extensions such as .txt, .log, .pdf, and .png. These files come in different sizes, some old and some new, and they might be either raw or cleaned. Your goal is to automate several tasks; create folders for each file extension and organize the files accordingly, delete older log files, move large text files to a separate folder within the ‘.txt’ directory, and finally, separate the cleaned log files from the raw ones. Your task is to create a program that automates this process.

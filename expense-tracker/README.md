# Project - Expense Tracker

## Overview:
An expense tracker is a useful tool to manage your finances and keep track of your spending. In this Python project, we will create a simple console-based expense tracker that allows users to record their expenses, categorize them, and view a summary of their spending habits. This project will help you learn about data storage, user input, and basic data analysis in Python.

## Features:

1. Expense Recording: Easily add and categorize expenses with date and description.
2. Categorized Expenses: Group expenses into custom categories (e.g., groceries, transportation, entertainment).
3. Expense Overview: Gain a quick overview of your financial status, including total expenses and income.
4. Graphical Visualization: Visualize your expenses and income through interactive charts and graphs.
5. Data Export: Export your financial data to various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) for further analysis or record-keeping.

## Skills and Concepts to Learn:

- Basic Python programming, including data structures (lists, dictionaries).
- User input and validation.
- File I/O for data storage and retrieval.
- Implementing loops and conditional statements for program control.
- Creating functions for modular code.
- Basic data analysis and reporting.
- Handling exceptions and errors gracefully.
- Implementing data persistence using files or databases (optional).

## How to Use the Expense Tracker
To utilize the Expense Tracker effectively, follow these steps:
1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by running the following command:
```python main.py```

2. **Expense Entry**: Start recording your expenses by entering the date, amount, description, and category.
```sh
Enter the date (yyyy-mm-dd): 2023-10-15
Enter the amount: 25.00
Enter a description: Groceries
Enter a category: Food
```

3. **Expense Overview**: Review your financial overview, including total expenses, income, and savings.
```sh
Total Expenses: $250.00
Total Income: $1000.00
Savings: $750.00
```

4. **Data Visualization**: Visualize your expenses and income through interactive charts and graphs to gain insights into your spending patterns.

5. **Data Export**: Export your financial data to formats such as CSV or Excel for detailed analysis or backup.

## Supported Categories
The Expense Tracker allows you to create custom categories to organize your expenses efficiently. Common categories include:

- Food
- Transportation
- Entertainment
- Utilities
- Rent/Mortgage
- Health
- Education
- Shopping
- Personal Care
- Miscellaneous
You can tailor these categories to suit your specific financial needs.

## Challenges:

To enhance this project, consider adding the following challenges:

- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using a framework like Flet.
- Supporting multiple user accounts with password protection.
- Generating monthly or yearly expense reports.
- Integrating a database or files to improve data management and retrieval.
- Implementing data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib for graphs and charts.

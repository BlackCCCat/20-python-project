# Project - Expense Tracker

## Overview:
An expense tracker is a useful tool to manage your finances and keep track of your spending. In this Python project, we will create a simple console-based expense tracker that allows users to record their expenses, categorize them, and view a summary of their spending habits. This project will help you learn about data storage, user input, and basic data analysis in Python.

## Key Features:

1. **Expense Recording**: Users can input their expenses, including the amount spent and a brief description of the expense.

2. **Expense Categories**: Expenses can be categorized into different groups such as groceries, entertainment, bills, and more. Users can choose or create categories for their expenses.

3. **Data Storage**: The project will store expense data in a structured format, such as a dictionary or a list of objects. This allows users to track multiple expenses over time.

4. **Data Analysis**: Users can view a summary of their spending, including the total amount spent, expenses by category, and potentially visualize their spending habits using basic charts or graphs.

5. **Data Persistence**: Implement data persistence to save expense data between sessions, so users can access their expense history even after restarting the program.

6. **Search and Filtering**: Allow users to search for specific expenses or filter expenses by category or date range.

7. **User-Friendly Interface**: Create a simple and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) that guides users through adding, viewing, and managing their expenses.

### Skills and Concepts to Learn:

- Basic Python programming, including data structures (lists, dictionaries).
- User input and validation.
- File I/O for data storage and retrieval.
- Implementing loops and conditional statements for program control.
- Creating functions for modular code.
- Basic data analysis and reporting.
- Handling exceptions and errors gracefully.
- Implementing data persistence using files or databases (optional).

### Challenges:

To enhance this project, consider adding the following challenges:

- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) using a framework like Flet.
- Supporting multiple user accounts with password protection.
- Generating monthly or yearly expense reports.
- Integrating a database or files to improve data management and retrieval.
- Implementing data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib for graphs and charts.

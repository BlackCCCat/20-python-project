# Microprocessor Simulation

A microprocessor performs different operations on its inputs, based on a signal
that tells it which operation to perform.

In this exercise, you'll write code to simulate what a processor does.

A program, from the view of a microprocessor, is a set of operations and values.
The processor will perform each operation on the values, one by one. For our simplified
example, it might look like:

```txt
add 8 16
mul 10 2
or 1 0
nand 1 1
```

At each step, our model of a processor outputs a value. For this
pretend program, the output at each step would be:

```txt
24
20
1
0
```

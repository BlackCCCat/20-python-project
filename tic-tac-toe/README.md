# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as "Noughts and Crosses" or "Xs and Os," is a classic two-player board game known for its simplicity and strategic depth. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to form a line of three of your symbols (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before your opponent does. Here's an overview of the Tic-Tac-Toe game:

## How to Play:

1. **Game Setup**: The game board is a 3x3 grid, and two players take turns marking the grid with their respective symbols, typically X and O. One player takes the X symbol, and the other takes O.

2. **Taking Turns**: Players take turns placing their symbol on an empty spot on the grid. The first player (usually X) starts the game.

3. **Winning Condition**: A player wins the game when they successfully place their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) of three. The game ends immediately when a player achieves this.

4. **Draw/Tie**: If all the spaces on the board are filled, and no player has formed a winning line, the game is declared a draw (also known as a tie or cat's game).

5. **Strategy**: Tic-Tac-Toe is a game of strategy. Players aim to create winning opportunities for themselves while blocking their opponent from forming a winning line.

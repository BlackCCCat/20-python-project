# To-Do List

A To-Do List, often abbreviated as "TODO list," is a simple yet powerful tool for task management and organization. It serves as a visual and organized way to keep track of tasks, responsibilities, and goals. Whether you're managing personal chores, work projects, or academic assignments, a To-Do List can help you stay focused and productive. Here's an overview of the To-Do List:

## Basic Functionality:

1. **Task Entry**: Users can add tasks or items to their To-Do List. These items can range from simple daily chores to more complex projects or goals.

2. **Task Organization**: To-Do Lists allow users to categorize, prioritize, or group tasks based on criteria like due dates, importance, or project categories.

3. **Task Completion**: As users complete tasks, they can mark them as done or remove them from the list. This provides a sense of accomplishment and helps keep the list tidy.

4. **Reminders**: Some To-Do List applications or tools offer reminder features that can alert users about upcoming tasks or deadlines.

5. **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their progress over time, reviewing completed tasks and assessing their productivity.

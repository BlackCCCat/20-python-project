# Word Counter

Just imagine Google docs; it can display the number of words you have written. Although it is hidden, you can choose to display it as you write. You got it right. So, you will be building a word counter that counts the number of words in a file. I have included working with files because I want you to master working with files. If you want to get more inspired, you could also count characters, lines, and paragraphs.

**Bonus**: 
You could check for short and long words, as well as the number of occurrences of all words(word frequency). You can also calculate reading level, reading time, speaking time, synonyms and perform grammar and spell checks. The template is provided in a README.

## Skills you will learn: 
- Working with files and file operations,
- loops
